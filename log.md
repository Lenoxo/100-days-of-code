### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 7: December 27, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

- [**"The Last Algorithm Course You'll Need"**](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/): Today I advanced two classes in where I learned how to implement a **DoublyLinkedList**, but I wasn't able to finish today the implementation part. So, it's for tomorrow.
  - Also, I did a brief recall of some stuff I was forgetting, like BinarySearch, the changes are in one of my repos: [click](https://github.com/Lenoxo/HTML-CSS-JS-challenges/tree/108ce293120b1d5d352be00f9bccd3c8902ead9e/src/DSA-challenges)

**Thoughts**: I finally understood how recursion works in a basic level, with that being said, I have to admit that one of the things that slows me down for now is also learning how to use vim motions, but I'm getting used to them pretty quickly during these last couple of hours.

### Day 6: December 26, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

- **The Last Algorithm Course You'll Need**: Today I advanced one class in "The Last Algorithm Course You'll Need" and learned the basics of how to use quick sort.

**Thoughts**: Now it's a bit easier for me to visualize how do recursive calls happen, but I still feel that need some practice to fully understand it.

### Day 5: December 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

- **The Last Algorithm Course You'll Need**: I dedicated today to practice and understand better recursion, and now I feel that, in an easy problem I understand how to apply it, also, all the exercises I did with it, are in one of my github repos: [click](https://github.com/Lenoxo/HTML-CSS-JS-challenges/blob/main/src/JS-challenges/recursion.js)
  - Resources I used today:
    - [Google DataStructures and Algorithms free course](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/#sequence-9)
    - [¿Qué es la Recursividad?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwRjEOFxvO0)
    - chatgpt for creating some of the challenges.

**Thoughts**: I really feel that is difficult for now to visualize how the functions recurse themselves in every case, I still don't get it for now.

### Day 4: December 24, 2023 - Merry Christmas!

**Today's Progress**:

- **The Last Algorithm Course You'll Need**: Today I advanced just one class, and also, because currently, after doing the exercise, I'm even more confused about how to implement recursion, so, later or next day, I'll practice some time with other resources to understand better how recursion works.

**Thoughts**: Yesterday, I missed a day, for something that was out of my control at that time, more specifically, working and helping with a relative throw all day, and when I finished, I just had time to go to sleep and that's it.

Now, I think I could handle it better, waking up earlier to practice 1 hour before anything else in my day.

### Day 3: December 22, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

- **The Last Algorithm Course You'll Need**: Today I advanced three classes; Data Structures Q&A, Recursion and Path Finding: Base Case. (Which is the first part of recursion implementation)

  - Also, in this same topic, I found a great playlist in YouTube where a developer explains how different Data Structures are implemented in Typescript: [DataStructures List](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn4fTSbSpY5cL4_0MP83wq5khbmG3IKKd)

- **Improving my current projects**: According to an excellent video I've seen today: [Link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7pXEy5i-Vs), now I'll be improving continuously all my current projects adding / setting up this:

  1. Code clarity: Making consistent the way I format code

  - Unit testing: Just for the critical features.

  2. Good branching: Using an issues / functionalities based branching and PR
  3. Good issue management: Using mainly Github Projects
  4. CI / CD: In some projects I have this already

  - Today, I advanced with that issue management in [DevShop API](https://github.com/Lenoxo/DevShop)

**Thoughts**: Today I advanced more than yesterday, and also learned how, a project is managed professionally, thanks to a great resource by Bob Fornal, he always has something valuable to teach.

Well, other thing I would like to mention is that I'm still kind a newbie with Twitter. So 1 step at a time.

### Day 2: December 21, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

- **The Last Algorithm Course You'll Need**: Today I advanced one class; ArrayBuffer or also called Ring Buffers.

**Thoughts**: Today I did two things:

- Accidentally erased my last week notes from the course and restoring them from scratch took me most of today's hour.
  - It happened because I forgot to save a backup of the .mozilla folder
- Trying to understand how that recycle of space works on the Ring Buffers, actually, I still don't understanding it well, so I'll search more about them tomorrow.
  Also, I really wanted to advance more but today I didn't manage well my time, so, I know what I have to prioritize.

### Day 1: December 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

- **Async-Landing**: Add links to my updated social media, own website and improving navbar links.
- **The Last Algorithm Course You'll Need**: Today I advanced two classes; Arrays vs Linked Lists and ArrayList.

**Thoughts** I wonder if I should share my current notes taken in Draw.io, because until I finish a course, they're really changing every single class / research I made.

### Day 0: December 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Set up the learning plan, I'll do the following during the next 100 days:

1. **Learning about DSA**: Using the free course from Frontend Masters [The Last Algorithm Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/)
2. **Learning about Docker**: Using the Platzi's Docker course [Curso de Docker](https://platzi.com/cursos/docker/)
3. **Learning about Typescript**: Using mainly Typescript docs and other resources if I hit a hard problem [Typescript Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
4. **Building side projects**: This one is hard to predict, because I have some ideas but none of them concrete, so during the above learning phase, I'll use some time to search for ideas of projects that could be a rewarding challenge to build.

   - **A webchat app**: Because currently I don't know how to work with websockets.
   - **Improving my current projects**: There are things I can improve of how I tackle new problems and issues.

**Thoughts:** I know that I don't need a perfect plan from day 0, but a flexible one, due to my current schedule.
