## Examples section

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

## Actual diary

### Day 0: December 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Set up the learning plan, I'll do the following during the next 100 days:
  1. **Learning about DSA**: Using the free course from Frontend Masters [The Last Algorithm Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/)
  2. **Learning about Docker**: Using the Platzi's Docker course [Curso de Docker](https://platzi.com/cursos/docker/)
  3. **Learning about Typescript**: Using mainly Typescript docs and other resources if I hit a hard problem [Typescript Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
  4. **Building side projects**: This one is hard to predict, because I have some ideas but none of them concrete, so during the above learning phase, I'll use some time to search for ideas of projects that could be a rewarding challenge to build.
    - **A webchat app**: Because currently I don't know how to work with websockets.

**Thoughts:** I know that I don't need a perfect plan from day 0, but a flexible one, due to my current schedule.
